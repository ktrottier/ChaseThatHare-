I decided to spruce up the racing game designed by Kelsey May and Malvin Yeung.

I liked how there is a cool image already in use to fill out the background.
So, I decided to keep it and elaborate a little bit.  I split the game into two pages -
The opening page only has the header/title of the game and a large button to "play" the game.
I left the background of the image alone on this page.  The second page has the image repeated, but only on the top layer.
Below the image I changed the background to a shade of green.

The first page links to the second page where the game is played.  I colored up the font, added font borders and changed
its styles and size, all around.  I thought the color green in a few different shades would appear appealing
to the player in a racing game.

I switched the text fields to line up horizontally, spaced them out and increased their size.
Whereas before they were just stacked vertically in the center of the page.

I also increased the size of the "GO" button and was sure to add another button to "return" to the first page.
All buttons have a "hover" psuedo-selector added.

I'm not sure if I broke the code for the game in the process but it doesn't seem to run as intended, quickly skipping
to the result after one click.  (Sorry if I did accidently alter something).

Anyway, hope you like it!
